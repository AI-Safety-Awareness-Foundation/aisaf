# Help Your Community Draft a Statement 📝

*Effort Level: ●●●○○ (3 - 10 hours)*  
*Areas: Technical, Policy, Community*

## Summary

One of the best ways for your community’s voice to be heard with regard to AI is to issue a public statement about it. This statement could be aimed at members of your community, at outsiders who are curious about your community’s stance on AI, or both. The statement could address questions such as:

- What aspects of AI could be helpful to your community?
- What aspects of AI could be harmful to your community?
- How does AI relate to your community’s broader goals and aspirations?
- How should members of your community use AI in their own lives?
- What should scientists know about your community and its beliefs when they are designing AI systems?
- What should corporations know about your community and its beliefs when they are implementing AI systems?
- What should policymakers know about your community and its beliefs when they are regulating AI systems?
- What does a positive AI future look like, according to the values of your community?

By making your community’s beliefs public and legible, it can increase the chances that those beliefs will be heard and taken seriously in the AI world.

## Examples

Since it can be hard to know where to start without a reference to work from, we have provided a list of community organizations which have published statements on AI. **Note: If we list an organization’s statement on this webpage, it should not be taken as an endorsement of that organization or that statement.** These statements are provided only because we think they may be helpful to other groups wishing to write statements on AI.
