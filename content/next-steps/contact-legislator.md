# Contact Your Local Legislator 🏛️

*Effort Level: ●●○○○ (1 - 3 hours)*  
*Areas: Community*

## Summary

Legislators at all levels need to hear from constituents about AI. Your voice helps ensure that AI legal governance reflects your values and those of the community that you are a part of. After all, if your community doesn't speak up, then your voice won't be heard!

When it comes to contacting your local legislator, generally you have three
options:

1. Meet them or their staff in person
2. Call their office
3. Write to them

It can be intimidating or seem very difficult to do any of these options, let
alone meeting with your legislator or their office in person, but know that
legislators are generally excited to meet you. Legislators often report that
talking with their constituents is the best part of their day and are actually
quite disappointed when a constituent doesn't show up!

## How To Do This

### Find Your Representatives

#### Federal Representatives (House and Senate)

- **U.S. House Representative**: Visit [https://house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative) and enter your ZIP code to find your congressional district and representative
- **U.S. Senator**: Go to [https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm](https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm), select your state from the dropdown menu, and click "Go" to find both of your state's senators

#### State Representatives & Senators

Each state has its own website for tracking down your state representatives.
This is usually findable via a web search engine (usually searching "[your state] legislature find my legislator" is sufficient).

### Choose Your Message

**We would prefer that you think for yourself what you're worried about and
excited about when it comes to AI and use that to decide what you want to talk
with your legislator about.** Hence we are reluctant to offer verbiage on
exactly how to talk to your legislators, or what to bring up. We hope that's
something you and your community can decide for yourselves.

However, we understand that it can sometimes be a bit nerve-wracking to talk
with a legislator. As such, if you can't think of anything, we've provided the
following starting template.


> Dear [government official],
> 
> My name is [your name], and I am a voter in your [city / state / district].
>
> I am writing regarding the importance of addressing AI and the potential impacts artificial intelligence will have on our community. As our representative, I believe your awareness and thoughtful engagement with AI policy issues will be crucial.
> [If you have more specific concerns or statements about AI, you can list them here.]
> I appreciate your time and attention to this important matter.
>
> Sincerely,
> [Your Name Here]
