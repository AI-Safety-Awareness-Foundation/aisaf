# Discuss AI with Your Community Groups üí¨

*Effort Level: ‚óè‚óã‚óã‚óã‚óã (Less than 1 hour)*  
*Areas: Community*

## Summary

Your community is going to be impacted by artificial intelligence, so it makes
sense to talk with your community about where AI is headed and how to prepare
for it. 

We would recommend starting out with a conversation with communities that you
already are a part of and know well. This could be your local church, your local
community center, a club, or just friends and family.

These conversations can be any level of formality and any number of people.
Getting the ball rolling on these discussions is more important than absolutely
nailing the first one!

Some questions that you might discuss include:

+ What aspects of AI could be helpful to your community?
+ What aspects of AI could be harmful to your community?
+ How does AI relate to your community‚Äôs broader goals and aspirations?
+ How are members of your community currently using AI in their own lives? How
  has this been helpful or harmful to them?
+ What do you think AI will be capable of doing in 1 year? 5 years?
+ Do you think AI has the potential to radically transform your lives? Why or
  why not?
+ Do you think AI has the potential to cause catastrophic damage on par with
  killing or disempowering all of humanity? Why or why not?

## Next Steps

If you've had your first discussion and would like to continue, we would
recommend that you and your community go through one of a variety of courses
that cover where AI is today and where it's going, see for example BlueDot
Impact's ["Future of AI"](https://bluedot.org/courses/future-of-ai) course,
which can be completed in just an hour or two. In fact it might make sense to go
through that course together as a group!

Use this as a chance to revisit some of the questions that were listed
initially and see if any of the answers to those questions have changed.

Feel free to [reach out to us](/contact) if you would like to have us come out
and do a workshop for you!

Once that's done, we would recommend one of the follow-up steps.
