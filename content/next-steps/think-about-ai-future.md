## Summary

In order to make sure that the AI future goes the way you want it to, you first
have to understand what you want! It's worth spending 30-60 min writing down a rough draft of your thoughts on this. We've found that often simply the act of putting words to paper is enough to clarify a lot of your thoughts.

The exact format of what to do here can vary from person to person. We would
recommend at least thinking through the following 5 questions:

1. What excites you most personally about AI's potential?
2. What worries you most personally about AI's risks?
3. What role should humans play in an AI-enabled world?
4. What is the worst/best case scenario for an AI future? Is scarcity solved?
   Does everyone get wiped out by AI?
5. What are warning signs that AI is on the path to becoming superhuman (but is
   not there yet?)? What are warning signs that AI is on the path to fizzling
   out?

+ What human activities or experiences do you hope will never be automated or replaced?

#### Values and Relationships

+ What kinds of work should remain fundamentally human, and why?
+ How might we restructure society if human labor becomes less economically necessary?

#### Decision-Making and Control

+ When should humans be in the loop for important decisions, and when is it okay for AI to decide?
+ How much should you understand about how an AI system works before trusting it with something important?
