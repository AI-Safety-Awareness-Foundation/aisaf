# Write an AI Safety Companion Piece for Your Community ✍️

*Effort Level: ●●●○○ (3 - 10 hours)*  
*Areas: Community*

## Summary

Most AI road-maps come from a narrow slice of Silicon Valley; companion pieces let other communities have a voice.

Recently, a number of AI experts have written pieces about where they think the future of AI is headed. One famous example is [“AI 2027”](https://ai-2027.com/), which is a group of experts’ best attempt at describing what the future will look like if scientists create superhuman AI by the year 2027. While “AI 2027” and similar works are insightful, they tend to be written from a very particular (mostly secular, affluent, well-educated, Bay Area techie) perspective. That perspective may be blind to the beliefs and concerns of other communities, which can alienate those other communities from much of the AI discourse.

One way to reduce this alienation is by providing companion pieces to popular works about AI. For instance, a church might write a Christian companion piece to “AI 2027”, which would detail how Christians should respond to the events described. Such a companion piece could:

- Introduce Christians to developments in the AI world that they otherwise would not have known about.
- Infuse Christian values and thought into an otherwise secular document.
- Help Christians more easily understand “AI 2027” by relating the document to Christian concepts that they are already familiar with.
- Enable Christians to more adeptly promote their values in the AI world, since they would be more familiar with AI developments and AI discourse.

Note that we are listing a Christian companion piece as merely one example among many. Similar things can be said for Jewish, Muslim, or secular communities’ companion pieces.

We think that “AI 2027” is probably the best work to write a companion piece for, since it is both well-researched and written to be understandable to a non-technical audience. Some other works that you might consider writing companion pieces for include:

- [Leopold Aschenbrenner’s “Situational Awareness”](https://situational-awareness.ai/)
- [Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares’s soon-to-be-published “If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies”](https://www.amazon.com/Anyone-Builds-Everyone-Dies-Superhuman/dp/0316595640)
- [The UK government’s AI 2030 Scenarios Report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/frontier-ai-capabilities-and-risks-discussion-paper/ai-2030-scenarios-report-html-annex-c)
