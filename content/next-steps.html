                        <h2>Understand What AI Future You Want</h2>
                        <p>
                            More than anything, the point of these workshops is to give participants a chance to think deeply about what is going on with AI and what is around the corner so that they can form an opinion about what kind of future they want.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After all, if AI is going to affect everyone, then everyone should have a voice, and the prerequisite to having a voice is having an opinion, and the prerequisite to having an opinion is knowing what's going on.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Action:</strong> Think for an hour or so at home about what kind of AI future you want. Consider both the things that excite you as well as the things that concern you. We highly recommend writing this downâ€”even if your opinions change over time, this exercise can be highly useful as a starting point.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Contact Your Local Legislator</h2>
                        <p>
                            Contacting your local legislator can sound scary, but it's actually not difficult at all! Whether it's your state legislators or your federal legislators, giving them a quick call and asking to speak with either their staff or the legislators themselves is quite easy to do.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You don't have to come with any sort of pre-planned policy agenda. Just letting them know that AI governance and AI safety is important to you is a fantastic first step. Legislative offices keep tallies of how many constituents are calling in about particular issues, so just expressing interest in the field itself is already very useful.

                            Connect with like-minded individuals in your area who are also interested in AI safety and governance. Local clubs provide ongoing discussion, learning opportunities, and community support for staying engaged with these important topics.

                            As we continue to run more workshops in more places and for more audiences, we are always looking for volunteers to help teach materials and potentially even run workshops on their own!

                            We appreciate the help, but we also have found that often teaching others is a great way to learn for oneself. This also lets you be a part of the process in deciding what materials we'll use in our workshops.
