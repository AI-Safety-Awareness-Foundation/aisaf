The AI Safety Awareness Foundation is a volunteer organization dedicated to raising awareness about modern AI, highlighting its benefits and risks, and how to ensure its safety.

We particularly focus on the following three areas:

1. Bridging the gap in awareness between frontier AI research and the general public and what risks exist with modern AI development

2. Equipping people with the tools and skills to participate in modern AI discussion and development

3. Building the social/political consciousness needed to convince policymakers to take AI and AI safety seriously

## AISAF Events

We are currently running hands-on workshops to help people: 

- Build and understand modern AI foundational models as well as what technological approaches are being used to try to ensure their safety and where current methods remain inadequate

- Understand the latest thinking and proposals in possible approaches to AI governance and regulation and what is still missing

- Get involved in AI safety both in technical and non-technical capacities
