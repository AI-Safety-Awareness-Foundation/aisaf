Join us for our latest community event in Los Angeles!

This event is co-hosted by BlueDot Impact, the AI Safety Awareness Project, and AE Studio â€” join and discuss AI safety with fellow technologists, researchers, students, and curious thinkers exploring the future of AI.

Last time we heard from AE's Alignment Team on their technical research, this time we'll feature AE's work in AI policy.

What to expect at the event:

- Hear from AE Studio's Alignment Team as they share an overview of their ongoing work and perspectives on AI alignment.
- Engage in discussions and connect with others committed to steering AI development toward beneficial outcomes.
- Meet alumni from BlueDot programs, AISAP workshops, and members of local communities interested in AI Safety.

(Parking validation available; hosts will assist with lobby entry and elevator access.)
