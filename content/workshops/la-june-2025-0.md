This free, non-technical workshop is open to anyone who’s ever wondered where artificial intelligence might ultimately lead
and wants to explore the topic in a relaxed, fun, and interactive setting. 

We’ll review the history of Artificial Intelligence, emphasizing the astonishing progress made over just the last two years.

From there we’ll dive into big-picture ideas that excite (and sometimes unsettle) researchers: the singularity, the 
intelligence explosion hypothesis, and the possibility of superintelligence. Using playful thought experiments and small-group 
activities, we’ll unpack why reward hacking, instrumental convergence, and rapid self-improvement matter—even if you’ve never 
written a line of code.

Expect approachable explanations, live demos, collaborative forecasts, and plenty of room for questions. Come curious; leave 
with a clearer picture of where AI could be heading and how we might navigate the journey together.
