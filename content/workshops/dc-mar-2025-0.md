When will Artificial Intelligence reach human level intelligence? What impact will this have on the economy and global stability? Should we accelerate AI development, or slow it down?

These kinds of questions have become increasingly salient in the past few years, with companies like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic doing what was once considered impossible.

Ultimately, we don't know what the future will look like, but by looking at what's possible today and extrapolating, we can make an educated guess. At this workshop, we will learn about the trajectory of this transformative technology and what we can do to influence its development.
During the workshop, we will:

Look at the predictions of frontier AI labs and experts in the field
Demonstrate the power of AI to launch targeted cyberattacks and generate misinformation
Practice making predictions on key questions about AI's future
Discuss what can be done to positively steer the development of AI
This event is open to anyone regardless of experience level with AI. Paid parking is available, but the library is also within walking distance of Foggy Bottom-GWU Station, so taking the metro might be more convenient.
