This is a free workshop open to all! Registration with Oakland Library is REQUIRED for this event: [https://oaklandlibrary.bibliocommons.com/events/6850700f6d83b22800d35cd3](https://oaklandlibrary.bibliocommons.com/events/6850700f6d83b22800d35cd3)

​This free, non-technical workshop is open to anyone who's ever wondered where artificial intelligence might ultimately lead and wants to explore the topic in a relaxed, fun, and interactive setting.

​

​We'll review the history of Artificial Intelligence, emphasizing the astonishing progress made over just the last two years.

​

​From there we'll dive into big-picture ideas that excite (and sometimes unsettle) researchers: the singularity, the intelligence explosion hypothesis, and the possibility of superintelligence. Using playful thought experiments and small-group activities, we'll unpack why reward hacking, instrumental convergence, and rapid self-improvement matter—even if you've never written a line of code.

​

​Expect approachable explanations, live demos, collaborative forecasts, and plenty of room for questions. Come curious; leave with a clearer picture of where AI could be heading and how we might navigate the journey together.
