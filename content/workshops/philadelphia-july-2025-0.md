In this free, hands-on workshop we’ll trace the fast-moving arc from classic machine-learning models to today’s autonomous “agents” that plan, reason, and act on our behalf.

We’ll start with a plain-language primer on what Generative AI and Agentic AI are, and discuss the underlying flows and tools that define agentic behaviors. Along the way we’ll spotlight the dizzying pace of progress, sketch out credible roadmaps for the next few years, and discuss the implications that come with delegating decisions to software.

Expect live demos of agents booking travel, writing code, and coordinating multi-step tasks, followed by guided coding labs where you’ll customize and launch your own mini-agent. Python fluency helps, but enthusiasm and a laptop are the real prerequisites. Bring question and curiosity; leave with new skills and a clearer sense of where AI is heading. Everyone’s welcome, and—as always—there’s no cost to attend.
