# AI and AI Safety Forecasting Seminar

Hi folks! This is an AI safety meetup aimed at teaching the public what modern
AI is capable of, both good and bad, and giving people an introduction to the
skills and knowledge necessary to predict what else might be coming around the
corner.

Weâ€™ll be kicking off with a gentle introduction to the state of AI today before
going into more detailed forecasting exercises.

Stay tuned for details!
