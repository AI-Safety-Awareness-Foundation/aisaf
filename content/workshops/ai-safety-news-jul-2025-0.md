Join our "Latest News in AI Safety" discussion group to catch up on recent research and policy news. We'll look at reports from Palisade Research on o3 and Claude 4—such as their attempts to avoid shutdown and blackmail engineers—and Redwood Research's work on models that pretend to be aligned. We'll also talk through New York's new RAISE Act, the end of the proposed state-level moratorium in the latest federal bill, and other legislation in the pipeline. 

Everyone's welcome, whether you follow these topics closely or are just curious—bring your questions and thoughts!

**Facilitator:** Noah Wilson (open to others joining)

**Duration:** 1.5 hours
