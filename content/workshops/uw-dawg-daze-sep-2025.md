​This free, public workshop is for anyone curious about where AI is headed—no technical background needed.

​
​In the past 8 months, AI has taken leaps that many experts thought were years away. We'll explore what's changed, where the technology might be in the next 1–5 years, and what that means for your life. Along the way, we'll dive into big questions:

​
​Could AI lead to widespread job losses sooner than we think?
​Will people form deep emotional relationships—or even start "dating"—AI assistants?
​How do top AI researchers believe these trends will shape our world?
​
​You'll get:

​
​A fast-paced, beginner-friendly overview of current AI capabilities
​Live demos showing both the power and the risks of today's systems
​An interactive forecasting exercise to test your predictions about AI's future
​
​Come ready to explore a future that's arriving faster than most people realize—one that could change not just how we work, but how we live, connect, and even love.
