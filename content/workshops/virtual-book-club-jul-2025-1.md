This event is for people who: a) would like to get into AI Safety and b) like reading :)

**What to read:** The Alignment Problem, Chapter 4 - on Reinforcement. (each chapter is stand-alone and doesn't depend on previous chapters)

**Format:**
- Quick 15-min intro around attendees
- 45-min - guided discussion + breakout room mini-chats

For this series, we will be reading Brian Christian's "The Alignment Problem", an accessible and comprehensive AI Alignment-related book that non-technical readers can read. Currently it's available on Amazon in paperback form, or may be also available at your local library.

For this session, we will read Chapter 4 - on Reinforcement. But do feel free to read beyond that!
