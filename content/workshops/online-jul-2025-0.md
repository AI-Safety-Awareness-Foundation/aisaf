Ever wonder how neural nets actually do some of their computation? Wanted to
know more about what this "mechanistic interpretability" thing is and how it
relates to AI safety, but don't have experience with building LLMs from scratch? This is the workshop for you!

We'll be analyzing how simple neural nets perform image recognition. This
workshop is meant for people who have previously built and trained their own
simple neural nets previously, but does *not* require LLM knowledge.

This workshop will consist of an introduction talk into mechanistic
interpretability of simple neural nets, some guiding principles, and then a hands-on exercise
where we actually do some interpretability exercises.
