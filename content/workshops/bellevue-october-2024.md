NOTE THAT THE ORIGINAL TIME ON THIS EVENT WAS INCORRECT: It has been changed to Oct 29th from the original time of Oct 28th.

This is a free hybrid meetup open to the general public about AI safety legislation. Feel free to join us either in person or remotely!

Heard about AI and curious about what AI regulation and governance might look like? Want to see a real-life example of it? Then this is the workshop for you!

We'll be talking about AI safety legislation and specifically focusing on California's SB-1047 bill, which was the focal point of a lot of national discussion over the last few months when it was passed with overwhelming support by the California state legislature before finally being vetoed by California's governor Gavin Newsom.

This workshop is meant for people of all backgrounds and levels of familiarity both with AI and the legislative process. Please come join us even if you know little about AI or the legislative process! The point of this workshop is to familiarize attendees with what kinds of AI regulation is currently being discussed and why it's important.

We'll be covering both the details of what SB-1047 set out to do, describing the arguments marshalled by both those for and against the bill, and going over the timeline of events to understand how a bill that had a 75% majority vote in support was ultimately vetoed by the governor. We'll then break into discussion groups to talk about how your own personal thoughts on the bill and what you might've changed.
