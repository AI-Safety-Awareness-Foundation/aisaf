Heard about AI and curious about what AI regulation and governance might look like? Want to see a real-life example of it? Then this is the workshop for you!

We'll be talking about AI safety legislation and specifically focusing on the RAISE Act, which just passed the New York State Legislature and is now awaiting signature by Governor Hochul.

This workshop is meant for people of all backgrounds and levels of familiarity both with AI and the legislative process. Please come join us even if you know little about AI or the legislative process!

We'll cover the details of what the RAISE Act aims to do, and read some of the arguments marshalled by both those for and against the bill. We'll also split into breakup groups to give you an opportunity to share your opinions about the bill.

NOTE: Because we received so many RSVPs for this event, our venue has reached capacity. We are now waitlisting all additional registrants, and requiring that all attendees have an RSVP before they enter the venue. If you initially RSVP'ed but now are not planning on coming, then please update your RSVP so that others can come off the waitlist.
