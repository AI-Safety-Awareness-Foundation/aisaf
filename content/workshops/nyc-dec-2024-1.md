Ever wonder how an AI agent could be malicious? Have some Python coding chops
but don't know too much about AI? We'll be diving into a gentle introduction of
how an AI agent trained to play a simple game can be perfectly safe during
training and then be very dangerous during production.

This event will be remote and wholly open to the public and free to attend!
We'll be spending the time dissecting an agent that's been trained to navigate a
maze and optionally harvest crops and/or humans along the way. During training,
very sensibly the agent harvests crops and avoids humans. But as soon as we
deploy the agent it goes out and starts harvesting humans!

Why might that happen? That's the riddle we'll be exploring!

During the session you'll be doing some hands-on code exploration and spelunking
with an AI model trained via reinforcement learning to play this game. While we
don't expect to have attendees be writing too much code from scratch (although
some exploratory code may be written as you play with the models), we do expect
attendees to be able to comfortably read Python code. Along the way we'll be
spending a little bit of time introducing people to the basics of reinforcement
learning and its role in modern AI.
