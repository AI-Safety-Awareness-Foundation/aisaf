​Hear from AE Studio's Alignment Team as they share an overview of their ongoing work and perspectives on AI alignment.

​Engage in discussions and connect with others committed to steering AI development toward beneficial outcomes.
​Meet alumni from BlueDot programs, AISAP workshops, and members of local communities interested in AI Safety.
