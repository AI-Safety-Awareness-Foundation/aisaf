This is a free AI safety meetup aimed at teaching the general public what modern AI
is capable of, both good and bad, and giving people an introduction to the
skills and knowledge necessary to predict what else might be coming around the
corner.

This event is meant very much for a general audience; this means that we will
be assuming very little about people's technical backgrounds or previous
experience and knowledge of AI. 

On the other hand, we also encourage people who may have a strong technical
background or strong AI development experience to attend.  Our hosts have
previously built and trained LLMs and done low-level analysis on them, so we're
happy to talk shop about more technical details in today's models.

Weâ€™ll be kicking off with a gentle introduction to the state of modern AI today 
going into more detailed forecasting exercises.

In particular our event will cover:

1. An exploration of what modern AI models currently are and are not capable of
2. Understanding the landscape of risk and dangers associated with current and future AI models
3. Using prediction markets to calibrate expectations and help forecast what kinds of AI developments might come and when
