Ever wonder how transformers actually do some of their computation? Wanted to
know more about what this "mechanistic interpretability" thing is and how it
relates to AI safety? This is the workshop for you!

We'll be analyzing how transformers perform induction (in particular in the vein
of mechanistic interpretability as first kicked off by Anthropic's 2021
transformer circuits paper). This workshop is meant for people who have
previously built and trained their own transformers previously. We will assume
that people are already very familiar with a standard decoder-only GPT-2-style
transformer.

This workshop will consist of an introduction talk into mechanistic
interpretability of LLMs, some guiding principles, and then a hands-on exercise
where we actually do some interpretability exercises.

You will need to bring a computer to participate!
