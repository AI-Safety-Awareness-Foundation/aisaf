​Join us for a community event in New York City!

​This event is co-hosted by BlueDot Impact, the AI Safety Awareness Project, and AI Safety NYC. We'll be gathering for an evening of conversation and community around the question: How can we help shape good AI governance?

​Joining us is New York State Assemblymember Alex Bores for a conversation on AI policy, public voice, and the need for thoughtful tech governance in New York and beyond. He is author of the recently passed RAISE Act which, if signed into law, would establish safety standards for frontier AI models. (Note: AISAP is not endorsing Assemblymember Bores or the RAISE Act. We are including Bores for educational and professional development purposes only.)

​The evening will feature:
+ ​A short talk by Assemblymember Bores on the RAISE Act and the future of AI policy
+ ​An open Q&A with attendees
+ ​Time to connect, network, and share ideas over light snacks and beverages

​Whether you’re deep in the world of AI or just curious about how policy is catching up to fast-moving tech, this event is for you. Expect a thoughtful, welcoming crowd of:
+ ​BlueDot Impact course alumni and community members
+ ​Technologists, researchers, and civic leaders
+ ​New Yorkers curious about the societal impacts of AI
