# Contact Us

Whether you're an individual curious about AI, wanting to learn more about its potential impacts and risks, or looking to contribute to a safer AI future, we welcome your thoughts and questions.

Are you an organization working in AI safety? Or perhaps you have insights about large-scale AI concerns? We'd love to collaborate with you! Our mission is to bridge the gap between AI safety research and public awareness.

You can reach us at: [info@aisafetyawarenessfoundation.org](mailto:info@aisafetyawarenessfoundation.org)
