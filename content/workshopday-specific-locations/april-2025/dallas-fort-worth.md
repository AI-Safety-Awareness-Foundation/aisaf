This is a free workshop open to the public for all levels of experience with AI. We’ll give a quick overview of the current state of AI capabilities, focusing on the significant changes over the past 5 months, as well as projections for the next 1-5 years.

The purpose of this workshop is to provide a broad introduction to the risks and benefits of current and near-future AI systems, as well as insights into how AI researchers at top companies view the future of AI development.

We’ll begin with an introductory talk, showcase demonstrations of current AI capabilities and associated risks, and conclude with forecasting and prediction exercises about the future trajectory of AI.
