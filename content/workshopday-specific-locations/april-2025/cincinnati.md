This is a free workshop open to the public for all levels of experience with AI. We’ll give a quick overview of the current state of AI capabilities, with a focus on how much has changed in the last 5 months, as well as where AI is going over the next 1-5 years.

The purpose of this workshop is to give a broad introduction to risks and benefits of current and near-future AI systems as well as how AI researchers at top AI companies view the future of AI development.

We’ll have a quick introductory talk, some demonstrations of current AI capabilities and risks, and then close with some forecasting/prediction exercises about where AI might be going in the future.
