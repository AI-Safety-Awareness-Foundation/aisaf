This is an interactive 1.5-hour workshop, free and open to the public, focused
on AI forecasting and safety awareness.

Our goal is to help participants understand the urgency of AI safety through
interactive demonstrations and group exercises aimed at helping people forecast
what might be coming over the next year or two with AI and AI safety.

The first portion of this workshop will be a set of virtual talks and
demonstrations of current AI capabilities.

The second portion of this workshop will be more detailed forecasting exercises,
where we'll use prediction markets to calibrate expectations and help
forecast what kinds of AI developments might come and when.
