This is a free AI Safety Workshop that anybody and everybody can come to focused on increasing AI safety awareness by helping participants recognize the potential nearness of significant AI developments. This event is meant very much for a general audience; this means that we will be assuming very little about peopleâ€™s technical backgrounds or previous experience and knowledge of AI. On the other hand, we also encourage people who may have a strong technical background or strong AI development experience to attend.

The event is located in Room 111 of Davidson Hall at the University of Louisville.

Our event, in particular, will cover:

+ The current state of AI
+ Situational Awareness
+ Progress in AI
+ Demos of AI failures
+ What is AI safety?
+ AI Forecasting Exercise

The workshop is differing from the last workshop in that the intro slides are going to be different and the format and content of the forecasting questions is new!
